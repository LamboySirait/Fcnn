# Faster RCNN RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-deployment-on-local-host-using-flask-frame-work
In this Repository I have deployed the faster Rcnn model on flask to deploy it on local server and aslo provided the code for how to use AWS sagamaker to deploy your pre train model on aws 


download the pretrain model https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ETaNh2xfvJLscfSVPMjCfOLIEtFpCj60
and put it in model dir 

dowload the config file https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Vo9c1jbMnSDDOdRSrYAOSreczWHCFq3T
and put it in model dir 


after putting model and config file in model dir use visual studio and run the server.py in it's terminal to run it on local host using flask

keras-tensorflow-model-deployment.ipynb is aws sagemaker tutorial for deploy pretrain model which is trained on local machine using gpu gtx 1650
